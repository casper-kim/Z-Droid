An OpenZwave (server) implementation in Java for Android


This project is abandoned, because a port of open-zwave in Java is not ideal.
(Every change in open-zwave would have to be ported.)
I also tried to get it working in the android-ndk, but that didn't go so well.

Feel free to use the code and let me know what you do with it.

Someone else made a complete port for Android.
check https://code.google.com/p/android-zwave/

I'll continue working on a tcp server in linux (see other repo).
